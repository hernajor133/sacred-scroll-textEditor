# sacred-scroll-textEditor


[Deployed Application on Heroku]()

## Description

This is a single-page, downloadable text editor you can use offline! It features a number of data persistency techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options isn't supported by the browser. Users can re-access their notes on page refresh, as they are stored in a database.

## Installation

Run `npm i` inside each folder with a .json file to install dependencies for back-end. For front end, simply open the application deployed on Heroku and click "INSTALL" to access locally and save to your device.

## Usage

Never lose your notes again! Jot down handy thoughts or reminders to yourself, or even write a narrative. Your text will be saved locally in a database for later access, even after the application has been closed.

## User Story

AS A developer
